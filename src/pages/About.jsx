          Founded in 2024, Eminence Intellitech has come a long way from its beginnings. When we first started out, our passion for eco-friendly and stylish products drove us to do intense research, and gave us the impetus to turn hard work and inspiration into to a booming online store.

          We now serve customers all over the world, and are thrilled to be a part of the quirky, eco-friendly, fair trade wing of the fashion industry.
